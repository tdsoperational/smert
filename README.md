A PoC ransomware i created while i was bored, buggy shit. 
Fully functional without external libs, however no key is saved, or sent. This means that the files will be forever encrypted.
Might expand functionality.

Please do not misuse this code, it's only a small project that was supposed to help me learn C. 
If you misuse this code, it's on you. Im not liable for any damage caused.
